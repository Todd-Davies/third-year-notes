\section*{Overview}

This course will explore certain classes of algorithms for modelling and
analysing complex systems, as arising in nature and engineering. These examples
include: flocking algorithms - e.g., how schools of fish or flocks of birds
synchronised; optimisation algorithms; stability and accuracy in numerical
algorithms.

\section*{Aims}

By the end of the course, students should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Be able to apply what they learnt across different disciplines.
\item Appreciate the emergence of complex behaviours in networks not present in
the individual network elements.
\end{itemize}
